**Please read this document thoroughly** and plan your work accordingly.
When ready, fork the repository and create a feature branch. It is in this branch we

### Implement a simple search application ###

<img src="https://github.com/ebrahimm2020/test-task/blob/main/search.jpg" style="width: 400px">
Implement a simple search form. The search should use a public REST API of your
choice using JavaScript.

- Search for title, return title (or something like that)
- Display partial search results in a list beneath the search field (Auto complete)
- Display the selected results in an editable list beneath the search component 

  * Selected search result should be saved with date/time stamp (as a
search history)
  * User should be able to delete a result from the list or delete the entire
list.

- The application should be responsive, adapting to changes of the viewport. 

### What we will look at: ###
- CSS3: Responsivity, use of pseudo elements, HTML entities and complexity
of solution
  * Surprise us with interesting solutions and show off your skills!
  * NOTE: Solution based on premade CSS frameworks will be completely discarded

- JS: complexity, sanity, comments and security.
  * The search should fetch data for each entry, don’t store a complete
database response in a variable and iterate through that.
  * Sanitize your inputs and don’t stress the API more than necessary.

- General sanity check on structure and solution
  * Show to us that you know - how front-end development should be
done.



When done, push your branch and let us know when it’s done.

**Good Luck and have fun!**
